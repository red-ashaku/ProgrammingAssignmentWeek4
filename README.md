Programming Assignment for Week 4

This script reads in data from the smartphone accelerometer project ("Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset") and subsequently
  1. merges the training and test datasets together
  2. applies column labels corresponding to the time and frequency domain variables
  3. extracts columns containing the time/frequency mean/stddev domain variables
  4. translates activity codes numbers into activity names
  5. calculates averages for each mean/stddev variable by activity and 
  6. returns a tidy dataset with the above averages, sorted by activity and subject

In order for the script to work, the data must be downloaded from

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

un-archived and stored in the working directory.
